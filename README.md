Contract Comparison Project

This project is a Contract Comparison and Classification System designed to process, classify, and analyze contract documents. It utilizes OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from PDF files and leverages machine learning models to classify contracts into predefined types based on their content. The system also identifies key keywords influencing the classification and provides a percentage match for accuracy.

Key functionalities include:

a)Uploading and processing contract PDF files.
b)Extracting text using pdf2image and pytesseract.
c)Classifying documents with a pre-trained machine learning model using TF-IDF for text vectorization.
d)Generating a summary of the document type, confidence level, and relevant keywords.
e)A route to train and save models for updating classification capabilities with new data.

This tool is ideal for legal professionals, businesses, or anyone handling large volumes of contracts to automate classification and improve efficiency.
